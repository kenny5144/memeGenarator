# Meme Generator App

This project is a simple meme generator application built using React.js. It allows users to create custom memes by adding text to the top and bottom of an image. The app consists of three main components: `Header`, `Meme`, and `App`.

## Components

### Header

The `Header` component displays the title and logo of the meme generator application. It includes an image of a troll face and some descriptive text.

### Meme

The `Meme` component is responsible for rendering the main meme creation interface. It allows users to input text for the top and bottom of the meme image. Currently, the input text is logged to the console when changed.

### App

The `App` component serves as the main entry point of the application. It renders the `Header` and `Meme` components within a main container.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, users are presented with the meme creation interface where they can input text for the top and bottom of the meme image. However, the functionality to generate a new meme image is not yet implemented.

## Next Steps

- Implement functionality to generate a new meme image when the user clicks the "Get a new meme image" button.
- Improve the styling and layout of the meme generator interface.
- Add more features such as the ability to upload custom images for meme creation.
